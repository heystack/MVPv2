<div class="about_block">
<span class="em">What's heystack about?</span>
<p>
Finding an easy and comfortable way for people in a community to see where they stand on all those questions (parenting, money, health, education...you name it) where perspective and tips from neighbors can be a big help but are otherwise hard to get.
</p>
<span class="em">What do I get out of it?</span>
<p>
Quick perspective on how you stack up on a question that matters to you, plus helpful info from your local community for tackling that topic better when you need to.
</p>
<span class="em">How does it work?</span>
<p>
<strong>Give</strong> your answer ("I pay my babysitter $10 /hr"), <strong>get</strong> an immediate picture of where you stand ("you pay 20% more than all neighbors"), <strong>find/share</strong> local tips/resources ("here's a rate approach another local parent of 3 kids under 10 used to good result"). The more who participate, the more helpful the info for all.
</p>
<span class="em">What kind of topics and questions get discussed?</span>
<p>
Purposeful ones, where some perspective and resources will help you do something better, make a more informed decision.  "Who's the best Beatle?"...interesting no doubt but handled better elsewhere.
</p>
<span class="em">Who's behind it?</span>
<p>
A couple of Alexandria parents who wanted a way to answer the "I wonder how we stack up and what others like us are doing on this?" questions that come up so often but for which the sources of credible, relevant, and local info are so few.</p>
